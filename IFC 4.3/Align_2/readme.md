## *Align_2*

### Intent

*This scenario shows an alignment with zero length circular curve between clothoids, zero length line segment between cuves, and a transition curve between two circular curves. Those zero length elements are not present in ifc file, they are just a concept.*

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon following other scenarios:
- *Align_1*

### Content

This scenario covers the following concepts and/or IFC entities:
- *In 1523.105 station, there is a zero length circular curve with 1103..685 radius*
- *In 2622.475 station, there is a zero length segment*
- *In 3945.196 station, there is a Clothoid with 972.837 starting radius and 1387.185 end radius*
