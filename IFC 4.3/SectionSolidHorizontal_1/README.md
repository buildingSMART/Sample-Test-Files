# SectionSolidHorizontal_1
---

### Intent

This scenario allows testing of section solid horizontal along a simple reference alignment.

The horizontal alignment is composed of a straight line, plus a transition curve and a circular curve.

The vertical alignment is composed of a straight line, plus a circular arc and another straight line.

The sectioned solid horizontal is in one piece or splitted every 30 meters along the alignment (with start and end params). 
    

### Prerequisites

This scenario does not builds upon other scenarios but a correct interpretation of the alignment parameters is required.

### Content

This scenario covers the following concepts and/or IFC entities:
- section solid horizontal
