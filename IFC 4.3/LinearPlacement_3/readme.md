# LinearPlacement_3
--- 

### Intent

This scenario demonstrates the usage of `IfcLinearPlacement` to setout road chevron signs by an alignment curve

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon following other scenarios:
- UT_Align_1 alignment test data provided by APLITOP

### Content

This scenario builds upon following scenarios:
- project structure
  - `IfcProject`
  - `IfcSite`
  - `IfcRoad`
- default unit assignment
  - `IfcUnitAssignment`
  - `IfcSIUnit`
- alignment
  - `IfcAlignment`
- core spatial structure
  - `IfcProject`
  -  `IfcSite`
  -   `IfcRoad`

This scenario might be extended by the following concepts: 
- GeoRef (see Georeferencing_1 scenario) 
- Element assemblies and aggregations
- geometry representations with sign as texture
